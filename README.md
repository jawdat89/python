# LeetCode Solutions and Algorithm Fundamentals in Python

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode algorithm questions and basic algorithms implemented in Python.

## Features

### Implementation of popular LeetCode challenges, including:
- String problems (e.g. `reverse_string.py`)
- Array problems (e.g. `two_sum.py`)
- Linked List problems (e.g. `remove_duplicates.py`)
- Tree problems (e.g. `binary_tree_max_depth.py`)
- Graph problems (e.g. `clone_graph.py`)

### Fundamental algorithms covered include:
- **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort
- **Searching**: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Graph traversal**: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search

## Usage

Clone this repository to access the code. Each algorithm is contained in a separate file, named according to the problem statement (e.g., `two_sum.py` for LeetCode's "Two Sum" challenge). The implementation details can be found within each file.
